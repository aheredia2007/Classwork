<P> What i learned to do this year was how to present in front of people and also how to do lil bit of css and like how to make different kind of types throughout the school year and I learned a lot of vocab words that are used in programming.  That the programmers use sometimes. What i could improve on is remembering the html skeleton and other tags and learning how to add css to my code whenever i finish doing some type of code. Something else i wanna work on is try to remember stuff on pycharm because when we start working on pycharm stuff than i can write it down and maybe i can remember it. and ya that's all burger and o don't gotta do nun better other than slow down when people are behind.</P>
