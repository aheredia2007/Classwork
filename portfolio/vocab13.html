    <h2> a suite of communication proto cols used for data trans mission over the internet</h2>
    <p>osi model</p>
    <h2>The OSI model, or Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework that describes how data communication occurs across networks, dividing network functions into seven distinct layers, each with specific tasks, to facilitate communication between different systems. </h2>
    <P>hyper text trans proto cal a proto cal that defines how web browes  and servers  exchange data primarilly  html documents using a  ipv6</P>
    <h2>domain name service </h2>
    <p>domain names into ip address which allows browsers  to get Url</p>
    <h2>ipv4</h2>
    <p>an ipv4 like the address system for the internet every device that comes to the internet</p>
    <P>cloud computing</P>
    <h2>In web development, cloud computing means using the internet to access and manage computing resources like storage, processing power, and software, rather than relying on local servers or hardware.</h2>
    <P>ipv6</P>
    <h2>ipv6 is an upgraded  (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet protocol, designed to address the issue of IPv4 address depletion by providing a much larger address space, enabling more devices to connect to the internet.</h2>
    <P>computer network</P>
    <h2>A computer network is a system of interconnected devices that share data and resources, enabling communication and collaboration through standardized protocols and physical or wireless technologies.</h2>
    <P>network proto cals</P>
    <h2>Network protocols are established sets of rules that define how data is transmitted and managed between devices on a network, enabling communication and data transfer despite differences in hardware or software.</h2>
    <p>file transfer protocol</p>
    <h2>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP-based network, such as the internet.</h2>
    <h2>Hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)</h2>
    <P>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data exchange on the web, a protocol that allows communication between web browsers and servers, while HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data transmission for privacy and security</P>
    <h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>
    <p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure, encrypted connection that allows users to access a private network or the internet as if they were directly connected to that network, even when using a public network like Wi-Fi.</p>
    <h2>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</h2>
    <p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), also known as a web address, is a text string that specifies the location of a resource on the internet, such as a webpage, image, or video.</p>
